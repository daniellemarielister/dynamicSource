## Welcome to the Drunken Goat Resturant App!
This app feature a landing page -'Home.js' which features the logo and Drunken Goat and branding colors. From there you can navigate the view the menu (<-like food) menu (<-like navigation>) page -'Details.js'. From their you can select which menu you'd like to view including Brekkie - 'Brekkie.js', Nourishments - 'Nourishments.js' and potions - 'potions.js'. There is a button for table booking which currently available.

## Why I went with Stack Navigation?
    1. Wanted the user to be forced to walk the through all the pages
    2. Since it's a pretty simple app i thought drawer nagivation or tab navigation weren't necisary.
    3. If the app would be developed further i would add drawer nagivation or tab navigation after the initial page to offer bookings and food orders.
